Summary: Enhanced release validation with automated CI/CD workflow

## TrainLoop Evals v0.7.3

### üöÄ Release Infrastructure
- **Automated Release Validation**: New GitHub Actions workflow for comprehensive release validation
- **Multi-Component Build Testing**: Validates all publishing builds (CLI, SDK, Studio) before release
- **Version Synchronization Checks**: Automated verification that all package versions match across Python SDK, TypeScript SDK, CLI, UI, and Runner components

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
- **Release Branch Workflow**: Triggers on pushes to `release/**` branches and VERSION file changes
- **Publishing Build Verification**: Tests Poetry builds for CLI and Python SDK, npm builds for TypeScript SDK and Studio UI
- **Release Notes Validation**: Enforces proper format with "Summary:" prefix requirement
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ubuntu-based validation with Python 3.11 and Node.js 20.x

### üîß Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive Status Reporting**: Clear success/failure indicators with emoji-based feedback
- **Structured Validation Jobs**: Separate jobs for structure validation, build testing, and version synchronization
- **Fail-Fast Validation**: Early detection of missing release notes or version mismatches
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamless integration with existing test workflows without duplication

### üìã Quality Assurance
- **Release Readiness Verification**: Complete validation pipeline ensures releases are deployment-ready
- **Multi-Language Support**: Validates Python (Poetry), TypeScript (npm), and UI (Next.js) components
- **Version Consistency**: Prevents releases with mismatched version numbers across packages
