Summary: Major documentation overhaul with comprehensive examples, new upgrade command, enhanced SDK reliability, and critical configuration changes

## TrainLoop Evals v0.9.0

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **BREAKING CHANGES**
- **Configuration Default Changed**: `flush_immediately` now defaults to `true` across all SDKs and config templates
  - **Impact**: Data will be written to disk immediately instead of being buffered
  - **Why**: Prevents data loss when processes terminate unexpectedly or files are moved/deleted
  - **Migration**: If you need the old behavior, explicitly set `flush_immediately: false` in your `trainloop.config.yaml`
  - **Affected Components**: All SDK configurations, scaffold templates, and example projects

### üöÄ New Features
- **Upgrade Command**: Added `trainloop upgrade` command for seamless CLI updates via pip
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Added full working examples for Python, TypeScript, and Go with custom metrics and evaluation suites
- **Documentation Site**: Launched complete Docusaurus-based documentation at evals.docs.trainloop.ai
- **Setup Script**: Created unified `./scripts/setup.py` for one-command monorepo setup
- **Standalone Integration Testing**: Added dedicated integration test runner for Python SDK to avoid pytest import conflicts

### üìö Documentation
- **Complete Rewrite**: Added 50+ documentation pages covering tutorials, guides, and API references
- **Interactive Examples**: Provided runnable code samples for all SDK languages with complete evaluation workflows
- **Architecture Guides**: Detailed explanations of system design, data flow, and component interactions
- **Development Docs**: Comprehensive guides for building from source, testing, and contributing
- **Integration Testing Guide**: Detailed documentation on SDK testing approaches and limitations

### üõ†Ô∏è SDK Enhancements
- **TypeScript SDK Import Validation**: Now enforces `collect()` before OpenAI/HTTP library imports with clear error messages
- **Python SDK Integration Tests**: Added standalone test runner to resolve pytest import conflicts
- **Enhanced Host Allowlist**: Expanded allowlist to support more LLM providers across all SDKs
- **Improved Error Messages**: Better guidance when import order is incorrect or SDK initialization fails
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Added `flush_immediately` to TypeScript and Python type definitions

### üîß Configuration & Reliability
- **Default Flush Behavior**: All SDKs now default to `flush_immediately: true` for data safety
- **Streamlined Setup**: Single command installs all dependencies across CLI, SDKs, and UI
- **Example Projects**: Each SDK example includes complete evaluation setup with custom metrics and proper configuration
- **Environment Templates**: Added comprehensive .env.example files for quick configuration
- **Enhanced Config Validation**: Better validation and error handling for configuration files

### üì¶ Dependency Updates
- **Python SDK**: Updated to latest LLM library versions
  - OpenAI: 1.50.0 ‚Üí 1.97.0
  - Anthropic: 0.58.0 ‚Üí 0.58.2  
  - LiteLLM: 1.50.0 ‚Üí 1.56.5
  - LangChain integrations and other dependencies updated
- **TypeScript SDK**: Enhanced import detection and validation
- **Go SDK**: Improved configuration handling and host allowlist management

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure & CI/CD
- **Automated Documentation Deployment**: GitHub Pages deployment for documentation site
- **Enhanced Testing Pipeline**: Improved CI/CD with standalone integration testing
- **Build System Updates**: Better monorepo management and dependency handling
- **Development Environment**: Improved setup scripts and development workflows

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Stability
- **TypeScript SDK**: Fixed import order validation, auto-initialization behavior, and type definitions
- **Python SDK**: Resolved integration test failures and import conflicts with pytest
- **Documentation Links**: Corrected GitHub organization capitalization inconsistencies  
- **CI Authentication**: Fixed GitHub Actions token authentication for docs deployment
- **Config Type Safety**: Added missing type definitions for flush_immediately across SDK languages

### üß™ Testing Improvements
- **SDK Integration Testing**: New standalone test runner for Python SDK resolves pytest import conflicts
- **Test Coverage**: Enhanced test coverage for configuration handling and SDK behavior
- **CI Reliability**: Improved test reliability and error reporting in continuous integration
- **Documentation Testing**: Automated testing of documentation builds and deployments
