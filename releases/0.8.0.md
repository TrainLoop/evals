Summary: Enhanced Python SDK reliability with improved gzip parsing and comprehensive integration testing

## TrainLoop Evals v0.8.0

### üöÄ New Features
- **Integration Test Suite**: Added comprehensive integration tests for Python SDK covering OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, LiteLLM, and browser automation frameworks
- **Manual Flush Control**: Added `flush()` function and `flush_immediately` parameter for explicit control over SDK buffering behavior
- **Browser Automation Support**: Extended SDK compatibility to support browser-use library for web automation scenarios

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Gzip Parsing**: Fixed critical issue with gzip-encoded response parsing in Python SDK HTTP instrumentation
- **Response Handling**: Resolved content encoding issues across httpx, requests, and http.client libraries
- **Memory Management**: Improved stream handling to prevent memory leaks during large response processing

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
