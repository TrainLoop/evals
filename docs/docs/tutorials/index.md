# Tutorials

Welcome to the TrainLoop Evals tutorials! These step-by-step guides will take you from complete beginner to advanced user.

## Learning Path

Follow these tutorials in order for the best learning experience:

### üöÄ Getting Started

**[Quick Start Guide](getting-started.md)** - Set up TrainLoop Evals and run your first evaluation (5 minutes)

Start here if you're new to TrainLoop Evals. You'll learn the core concepts and get a working evaluation setup.

### üìä Core Evaluation Skills

**[Writing Your First Evaluation](first-evaluation.md)** - Create custom metrics and understand the evaluation process (15 minutes)

Learn how to write effective metrics and organize them into suites for comprehensive evaluation.

**[Advanced Metrics with LLM Judge](advanced-metrics.md)** - Use AI to evaluate AI with sophisticated metrics (20 minutes)

Move beyond simple rules to sophisticated evaluation using LLM Judge for complex quality assessments.

### üèÜ Model Optimization

**[Benchmarking and Model Comparison](benchmarking.md)** - Compare LLM providers and find the best model for your use case (15 minutes)

Learn to systematically compare different LLM providers and models to optimize both performance and cost.

### üîß Production Deployment

**[Production Setup and CI/CD](production-setup.md)** - Deploy TrainLoop Evals in production environments (30 minutes)

Set up automated evaluation pipelines, monitoring, and integration with your development workflow.

## What You'll Learn
