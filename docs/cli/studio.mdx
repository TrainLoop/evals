## Tutorial

Run `trainloop studio` to start the local UI on port 3000.

```bash
trainloop studio
```

## How‑to

Specify a different port:

```bash
trainloop studio --port 8080
```

Launch using a local tarball for development:

```bash
trainloop studio --local trainloop-studio-runner.tgz
```

## Reference

Starts the Studio UI using the data folder defined in your configuration. Options:

- `--config <path>` – path to a config file.
- `--local <tar>` – path to a local Studio build.
- `--port <number>` – HTTP port.
- `--host <address>` – host binding address.

## Explanation

The Studio server reads evaluation results from the configured data folder. Ensure `TRAINLOOP_DATA_FOLDER` points to a valid path and that the folder exists. The config cascade matches the [`trainloop eval`](./cli-eval) command. See [Environment Variables](./cli-env-vars) for details.
