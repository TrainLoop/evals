| --- | --- | --- |
| `TRAINLOOP_DATA_FOLDER` | Path to the data directory used by all commands | `./trainloop/data` |
| `TRAINLOOP_CONFIG_PATH` | Path to the config file | autoâ€‘discovered |
| `TRAINLOOP_LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`) | `INFO` |

Set these variables before running commands or define them in your shell profile.
