## Tutorial

After collecting events with the SDK you run `trainloop eval` to produce results.

```bash
trainloop eval
```

## How‑to

Run a single suite by name:

```bash
trainloop eval --suite my_suite
```

Use a custom config file:

```bash
trainloop eval --config path/to/custom.yaml
```

## Reference

Evaluates events from the configured data folder and appends results under `trainloop/data/results/`.

Options:

- `--suite <name>` – run only the specified suite.
- `--config <path>` – path to `trainloop.config.yaml`.

Configuration files are discovered using a cascade. The command checks the `--config` argument, then the `TRAINLOOP_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable, and finally looks for `trainloop.config.yaml` in parent directories.

## Explanation

`trainloop eval` loads metrics and suites from `trainloop/eval/`. It processes new events in `trainloop/data/events/`. Results are stored alongside the events. When using the LLM judge, traces are consolidated under `trainloop/data/judge_traces/`.

See [Configuration](./cli-config) and [Environment Variables](./cli-env-vars) for more details.
