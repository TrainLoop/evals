The CLI loads settings from `trainloop.config.yaml`. A minimal file looks like:

```yaml
# trainloop.config.yaml
project: my-evals
```

Place the file in your project root or inside the `trainloop/` folder. You can override the location with the `--config` option or the [`TRAINLOOP_CONFIG_PATH`](./env-vars#trainloop_config_path) environment variable.

Configuration files are resolved in this order:

1. `--config` argument
2. `TRAINLOOP_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable
3. `trainloop.config.yaml` in the current directory
4. `trainloop/trainloop.config.yaml` in the current directory
5. The same search repeated in parent directories

Values in nearer files override those found earlier in the search.
