## Tutorial

Run `trainloop init` inside a project directory. The command creates a `trainloop/` folder with example metrics, suites, and a Python virtual environment.

```bash
trainloop init
```

## How‑to

Pass `--force` to overwrite an existing `trainloop/` folder.

```bash
trainloop init --force
```

## Reference

Scaffolds directories and installs `trainloop-cli` in `trainloop/.venv`.

- `--force` – overwrite any existing `trainloop/` directory.

## Explanation

The command prepares a workspace under `trainloop/` so you can start collecting events and writing metrics immediately. The data folder defaults to `trainloop/data/`. You can override it later using the [`TRAINLOOP_DATA_FOLDER`](./env-vars#trainloop_data_folder) environment variable.
