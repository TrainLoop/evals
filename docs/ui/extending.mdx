# Extending Studio

You can customize the Next.js code under `ui/`.

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` in the `ui` folder.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
3. Edit components or pages. Hot reload lets you see changes instantly.

The UI queries DuckDB directly. Add new views in `ui/database/duckdb.ts` and create API routes under `ui/app/api` to expose data.

Timing information comes from the `durationMs` field in your event JSONL files. Ensure your instrumentation records start and end times so charts work correctly.
